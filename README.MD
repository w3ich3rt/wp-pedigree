# WP Pedigree

As part of my work as webmaster for a dog breeding club, I was always allowed to add pedigrees of the dogs to the website. In the beginning it was pictures that were put on the website. Later, I created an HTML table for this and stored it on the web space.

Later, I was allowed to take the website and design to a new level and update it on Wordpress. This made a lot of things easy for me, but I couldn't find a really nice pedigree plugin that I wanted to use for us.

## Why a separate plugin?

Firstly, because I'm always curious to learn something new and perhaps make life easier for others, and secondly, because I wanted to make life easier for myself. :-)
I didn't want to constantly create new pedigrees for the dogs and sometimes even create them repeatedly.

## What is the purpose of the plugin?

With this plugin I would like to create the possibility at the end of the development that the animals can be created in a database and the parent animals can also be stored there, and then the pedigree of the animals up to the great-grandfather generation can be created.

## Table

This plugin will create a new table for the dogs. The table schema is described [here](TABLE_SCHEMA.MD).
